## Day 1 - 2nd June
 
Found Hadley Wickam's tweet about the project, read the document and emailed Martin and Michael to join. 

Got extrememly quick response, filled out the questionnaire and got access to the data.

Downloaded the data into this project. Thought for a moment that that might not be the intention of the project. But in that case they should have either made it impossible or at least asked nicely. 

But I'm planning on being super transparent and make detailed notes about the whole process anyway and I find my workflow more appropriate. 

### This already counts as data analysis

1. Having downloaded the dataset and the variable description I started skimming through both. 

2. About ten minutes in decided that even this 'exploratory skimming' is part of the path dependency of my analysis, so I should aim to document, pre-register etc. all my ideas. 

3. Ergo new version controlled project is set up now.
